# Mocafi Tiniest Project

##### I've just created the backend using mongoose and express to be the easiest and fastest to deliver this simple solution. 
##### The backend was deployed at: https://vercel.com
##### The frontend was deployed at: https://app.netlify.com
##### The database lives in: https://mongodb.com
##### Link to the online project: 

This project still needs a lot of modification that I can explain in the interview like:

* Making a logging system to be able to identify the user before getting the balance
* Frontend and Backend could be in the same project at Github, sorry, I've just created the projects and starting doing the things
* Making tests
* The architecture can be discussed later on
* Get the project inside a container

Thank you very much for your time!
